## 4. Notification System

**Purpose**: To implement a notification system in Canvas Flow that proactively alerts users about important events such as upcoming deadlines, new course materials, or changes in their schedule, thereby enhancing user engagement and ensuring they stay informed.

**Implementation**:

### Notification Table

- Develop a dedicated table in the database to store notification data. This table should include fields such as user IDs, notification content, notification type (deadline, new material, schedule change, etc.), timestamps, and read/unread status.
- Design the table schema to efficiently query and retrieve notifications, considering indexing strategies for faster access.

### Trigger-Based Notifications

- Utilize database triggers to automatically generate notifications based on specific actions or events within the application. For example, create a trigger that generates a notification when a new task is assigned to a user or when a task deadline is nearing.
- Ensure triggers are optimized to avoid excessive load on the database, especially in a system with a large number of users and frequent events.

### Delivery Mechanism

- While the database stores and triggers notifications, the actual delivery mechanism should be handled by the application server.
- Implement different delivery channels such as:
  - **Email Notifications**: Send emails for important alerts. This requires integration with an email service provider.
  - **SMS Notifications**: For critical alerts, consider sending SMS messages. This can be implemented using services like Twilio.
  - **In-App Notifications**: Display real-time notifications within the application interface. This involves frontend development to handle notification display and backend logic to push notifications to the client.
- Ensure the system respects user preferences for notification types and channels.

### Additional Features

- **Notification Settings**: Allow users to customize their notification preferences, such as which notifications they want to receive and through which channels.
- **Batch Processing**: For non-urgent notifications, consider using batch processing to reduce system load and avoid overwhelming users with too many notifications.
- **Analytics**: Track user interaction with notifications (like open rates, click-through rates) to analyze their effectiveness and user engagement.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: Design the notification system to be scalable and reliable, ensuring that it can handle a growing number of notifications as the user base expands.
- **Compliance and Privacy**: Ensure that the notification system complies with privacy laws and regulations, especially when dealing with user contact information.

By effectively implementing a comprehensive notification system, Canvas Flow can significantly enhance the user experience, keeping users engaged and informed about important aspects of their educational journey.
