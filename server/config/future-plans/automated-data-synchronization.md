## 2. Automated Data Synchronization

**Purpose**: To keep course and event data in sync with the Canvas API, ensuring that the Canvas Flow application reflects the most current and accurate information available.

**Implementation**:

### Scheduled Jobs

- Use cron jobs (Linux-based systems) or Windows Task Scheduler (Windows-based systems) to periodically run synchronization scripts.
- Set up different schedules based on the data criticality; for instance, more frequent updates for course deadlines than general course information.

### API Integration

- Develop scripts or backend services that interact with the Canvas API to fetch the latest course and event data.
- Ensure these scripts can authenticate correctly with the Canvas API, handling tokens or other authentication mechanisms.
- Structure API calls to maximize efficiency, perhaps using batch requests if supported by the Canvas API.

### Data Update Mechanism

- Design SQL procedures or scripts to efficiently update the database with the new or changed data fetched from the API.
- Consider using transaction management to ensure data integrity, where all changes are committed only if the entire update process is successful.
- Implement mechanisms to handle conflicts or duplicates, ensuring that data in the database remains consistent and accurate.

### Error Handling and Logging

- Build robust error handling within the scripts to manage API downtimes, rate limits, or data inconsistencies.
- Log key events and errors in a format that can be easily monitored, using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a simple logging solution like Winston for Node.js.
- Regularly review logs to identify and rectify recurring issues, enhancing the stability and reliability of the synchronization process.

### Additional Considerations

- **Incremental Updates**: Rather than fetching all data every time, implement an incremental update mechanism where only changed data since the last sync is fetched and updated.
- **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Respect the rate limits of the Canvas API to avoid being blocked or throttled. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in case of rate limit errors.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up a monitoring system to alert administrators in real-time for failures or significant delays in the synchronization process.
- **Data Validation**: Post synchronization, validate the integrity and accuracy of the data. Implement automated checks or alerts for data anomalies.
- **Documentation**: Document the synchronization process, including the schedule, the nature of the data being synchronized, error handling procedures, and any manual intervention steps.

By implementing an efficient and reliable automated data synchronization system, Canvas Flow can provide users with up-to-date information, enhancing the user experience and ensuring the reliability of the application.
